## Vehicle type recognition through audio signal processing
### Project summary:
This project is based on a paper titled "IDMT-Traffic: An Open Benchmark Dataset for Voice Traffic Monitoring Research" that implementation by DeepLearning.
The paper dataset is consisted of 4000 sound data of 4 types of vehicles: Bus, Car, Motorcycle and Truk. The neural network used in this paper is VGG16. The VGG is a Network that trained on dataset as ImageNet.
The accuracy of the work is 82%.
