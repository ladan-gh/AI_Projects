## Vehicle type recognition through audio signal processing
### Summary about the project:
This project is based on a paper titled "IDMT-Traffic: An Open Benchmark Dataset for Voice Traffic Monitoring Research" that implementation by DeepLearning.
This paper have a dataset with about 4000 sound data from 4 vehicle include: Bus, Car, Motorcycle and Truk. The Nural Network used in this work is VGG16 Net. The VGG is a Network that trained on dataset as ImageNet.
This project has been able to reach 82% accuracy in the dataset.
